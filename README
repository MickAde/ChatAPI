<!-- CHATAPI -->
<!-- DESCRIPTION -->

This project is a RESTful API implementation for an AI-powered chat system.
Users can register, log in, interact with the AI chatbot, and manage their token balance. 
The system leverages Django REST Framework (DRF) and includes features like user authentication, token-based interactions, and chat history management.

<!-- Features User Registration -->

Registers new users with a default token balance of 4000. Ensures unique usernames. User Login

Authenticates users via username and password. Returns a token for future authenticated API requests. AI Chat Interaction

Deducts 100 tokens per question asked. Provides AI-generated responses (dummy implementation for demonstration). Saves chat history (user message, AI response, and timestamp). Token Balance Retrieval

Displays the remaining tokens for the authenticated user.
